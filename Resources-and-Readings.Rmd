Once in a while you'll see a question posted to Stack Overflow or some other code list serve that's met with an RTFM (read the *&^%# manual) response from a salty programmer. So here's the ggplot2 manual:

[The ggplot2 manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/ggplot2.pdf)
[The ggplot2 page in the tidyverse]([https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/])

Resources like the library documentation on CRAN are generally not great for questions like

* [Can I use math type in a text annotation?](https://www.benjaminackerman.com/post/2019-03-08-equation_labels/)

But if your question is *how do I make the dots on my scatter plot blue instead of black?* You'll probably get some salty programmers screaming RTFM at you.
